    <p class="info">In 1906, Percival Lowell (founder of the Lowell Observatory) started a search for "Planet X", a possible ninth planet in our solar system. Despite capturing two images of Pluto, Lowell failed to recognize the object for what it was (foreshadowing). After Lowell's passing, the search for Planet X was resumed in 1929. On February 18, 1930, Pluto was officially discovered by 23-year-old Clyde Tombaugh (pog). It was named after the Roman god of the underworld, as suggested by 11-year-old Venetia Burney (even more pog).</p>
    <p class="info">Later that year, the name "Pluto" was adopted by Walt Disney for Mickey Mouse's pet dog. About a decade later, chemist Glenn Seaborg chose the name "Plutonium" for the newly-created element. There's a bunch of other info I could plagiarize directly from Wikipedia, but I'm running out of time for this submission (the gauntlet stream has already started so I'm panicking). Honestly, you can read more about Pluto <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/dwarf-planets/pluto/overview/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p class="info">So then a bunch of time passed & Pluto was unceremoniously stripped of its "planet" title by the IAU & I'm still salty about it!</p>
