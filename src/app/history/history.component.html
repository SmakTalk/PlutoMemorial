    <p id="info">In 1906, Percival Lowell (founder of the Lowell Observatory) started a search for "Planet X", a possible ninth planet in our solar system. Despite capturing two images of Pluto, Lowell failed to recognize the object for what it was (foreshadowing). After Lowell's passing, the search for Planet X was resumed in 1929.

It was named after the Roman god of the underworld, as suggested by 11-year-old Venetia Burney (even more pog).</p>
